# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** The programmer writes polymorphic code against interfaces; the compiler emits monomorphic, data-oriented C code with no vtables, no heap indirection, and no pointer chasing.
**Current focus:** Phase 52 - Emitter Refactoring (v0.1.2-alpha)

## Current Position

Phase: 53 of 54 (Analysis Improvements) -- second phase of v0.1.2-alpha
Plan: 1 of 2 complete
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-04-08 -- Completed 53-01 (return range propagation + conditional narrowing)

Progress: [#####-----] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17
- Average duration: 21min
- Total execution time: ~5.8 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v0.1-alpha]: Core dispatch with tagged unions -- shipped
- [v0.1-alpha]: Collection splitting with per-type sub-arrays -- shipped
- [v0.1.1-alpha]: Method syntax for collection operations
- [v0.1.1-alpha]: Full closure capture before collection methods
- [Phase 49]: Monomorphic collapse to standard Iron_List path (not plain typed array)
- [Phase 49]: Conservative monomorphic detection: only ARRAY_LIT-local collections
- [Phase 50]: Conservative TOP for function call return values (no interprocedural call-site analysis)
- [Phase 50]: Inline pointer registry in SplitList instead of embedding full Iron_Arena
- [Phase 51]: Memory investigation resolved -- no critical leak found
- [Phase 52]: emit_ prefix convention for all shared emitter functions; emit_ctx_cleanup for consolidated resource freeing
- [Phase 52]: Type declaration emission isolated in emit_structs module; estimate_type_size renamed to emit_estimate_type_size
- [Phase 52]: Split collection emission isolated in emit_split module; fusion emission isolated in emit_fusion module
- [Phase 52]: emit_expr_to_buf made non-static for cross-module access from emit_fusion.c
- [Phase 53]: func_ref resolution via value_table for CALL-site return range propagation
- [Phase 53]: Block entry range replace semantics (not intersect) for correct cross-path analysis
- [Phase 53]: Conditional narrowing shared in both collect_return_ranges and analyze_function_ranges

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 51 inserted: Memory Investigation & Leak Audit (resolved)
- v0.1.2-alpha milestone created: Phases 52-54 (emitter refactoring, analysis improvements, test hardening)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- emit_c.c monolithic problem RESOLVED by Phase 52 (4 sub-modules extracted)
- Value range analysis uses conservative TOP at call boundaries -- RESOLVED by Phase 53 Plan 01
- Monomorphic detection is local-only -- Phase 53 extends it interprocedurally
