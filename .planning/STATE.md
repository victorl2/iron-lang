## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Consolidated 8 research phases into 4 coarse phases — Frontend / Semantics+Codegen / Runtime+Stdlib+CLI / Comptime+GameDev+CrossPlatform
- Roadmap: TEST-03 assigned to Phase 1 (diagnostic error testing starts at lexer); TEST-01/02 to Phase 2 (first end-to-end pipeline); TEST-04 (ASan/UBSan CI) to Phase 3 (toolchain hardening)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research] Escape analysis precision contract (intra-procedural boundary) must be decided before Phase 2 semantic planning begins
- [Research] `rc` cycle detection strategy (`weak T` or debug-mode only) must be decided before Phase 3 runtime planning begins
- [Research] Generics monomorphization deduplication mechanism must be decided before Phase 2 codegen planning begins
- [Research] Windows threading abstraction (C11 threads vs tinycthread vs Win32) needs a spike before Phase 3 runtime planning begins
- [Research] Raylib binding strategy (hand-written vs header-generated) needs a decision before Phase 4 planning begins
