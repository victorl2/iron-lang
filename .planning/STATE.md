# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Every Iron language feature compiles to correct, working C code that produces a native binary
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — IR Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 11 (IR Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-27 — Roadmap finalized for v1.1 (5 phases, 52 requirements)

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- High IR before LLVM — decoupled IR enables backend swap without rewriting lowering logic
- SSA form for IR — enables future optimization passes and maps cleanly to LLVM IR
- Full codegen replacement — no dual-path maintenance burden; clean architectural break
- Alloca+load+store model for mutable variables — sidesteps phi-placement complexity
- Braun et al. 2013 SSA construction — single-pass incremental, no dominance frontiers needed
- Separate ir_arena from ast_arena — correct lifetime management as pipeline evolves

### v1.0 Accumulated Context (preserved)

- stb_ds used throughout for hash maps and dynamic arrays
- Arena allocator is primary allocation strategy in compiler
- Codegen uses fprintf to emit C text directly
- Runtime library is separate CMake target (iron_runtime)
- Integration tests: iron build -> execute binary -> compare stdout
- Cross-platform: pthreads on all platforms (pthreads4w on Windows)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
